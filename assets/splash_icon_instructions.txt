SPLASH ICON SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
================================

You need to add a splash icon image file to this assets folder.

Required file: splash_icon.png

Recommended specifications:
- Size: 512x512 pixels or 1024x1024 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Content: School/education icon or your app logo
- Simple design that works at various sizes

After adding the image file:
1. Make sure the file is named exactly: splash_icon.png
2. Run: flutter pub get
3. Run: dart run flutter_native_splash:create

This will automatically generate native splash screens for Android and iOS.

For now, you can use any education-related icon or your app logo.
